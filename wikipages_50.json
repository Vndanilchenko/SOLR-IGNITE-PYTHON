In 67 he was consul together with Gaius Calpurnius Piso. The two consuls proposed the Lex Acilia Calpurnia against bribery during canvassing for elections.In the same year Manius Acilius was appointed to replace Lucius Licinius Lucullus, who was unable to control his soldiers, as proconsul of Cilicia and the command of the Third Mithridatic War against Mithradates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of Armenia. While he was on his way to Pontus Mithridates won back almost all his kingdom and caused havoc in Cappadocia, which was allied with Rome and which had been left undefended. Manius Acilius did not march on Cappadocia nor Pontus but delayed in Bithynia. The 'lex Manilia' proposed by the plebeian tribune Gaius Manilius gave the command of the war to Pompey, who replaced Acilius. Little else is",

It was thus a natural choice for that seat's one-term Liberal member, Don Dobie, to transfer after his majority in Hughes was redistributed away. The division was named in honour of James Cook, who mapped the east coast of Australia in 1770. In 2006, the Australian Electoral Commission's Redistribution Committee for New South Wales proposed that the division be jointly named for Joseph Cook, who was Australia's Prime Minister in 1913-14. However as of 2021 no such action has been taken, and therefore Joseph Cook remains the only (eligible) Prime Minister who does not have a federal electorate named after him.\nFor most of the first quarter-century of its existence, Cook was a  Liberal seat; it has been in Liberal hands for all but two terms.

There are four brothers in total, and this book is mainly about their relationships and battles.
